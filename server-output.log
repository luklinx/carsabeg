(node:44000) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///C:/Users/VLINX/Desktop/carsabeg/next.config.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to C:\Users\VLINX\Desktop\carsabeg\package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
